Using Big Data to help you decide what to watch on Netflix!
How to Use NetPix
This command line Java application is intended for use with Stanford's Large Network Data set collection on Amazon movie reviews, available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html.
1. Place this file on the root of the project directory. 
2. Run WriteHashMap.java from a terminal to serialize the hashmap (so that when the application is run, it can sort the data and provide suggestions in real-time). This will take approximately 5-10 minutes
3. Run NetPix.java, follow the prompts, and you will have a great movie chosen for you in no time!
